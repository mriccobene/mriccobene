about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I design and build software systems considering <mark>architectural issues</mark> and human factors.

  My professional interests concern <mark>trustiness</mark> <mark>security</mark> and <mark>reliability</mark> of systems, 
  software architecture and the qualities it determines, and human computer interaction. 
  
  I have been a member of <mark>ACM</mark> since 2002.  

  I have written software using <mark>languages</mark> like C++, Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Solidity.

  I live and swim in Genoa.

  Ah, I think code is mostly for <mark>humans</mark>, not for machines ;-)

          A serverless application that uses AWS Step Function workflow to model an Ethereum transaction life cycle. 
          It signs & submits a tx, tracks its outcome, speeds up or recovers it if lost.

          The application enable an enterprise component to interact to an Ethereum-like blockchain 
          using an HTTP REST interface so fencing the underlying details.

          The project uses the <mark>serverless</mark> framework so the owner pay only when use it; 
          it generates an AWS Api Gateway backed by <mark>lambda functions</mark> and use MongoDB for persistence.
          The code is short thanks to its object-oriented model; lambda functions are clean for the same reason and only manage HTTP issues; 
          persistence is schemaless to truly take advantage of the NoSQL paradigm. 

          I used ethers.js for blockchain related tasks.

          A decentralized application for document certification, contract acceptance, property transfer that issues ERC-721 tokens.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I was a member of the team that developed this application. 
          We used the [Universal Login](https://unilogin.io/) framework for a frictionless user experience with blockchain,
          IPFS as document repository, an Ethereum sidechain as default blockchain, a tx relay infrastructure to pay gas using tokens,
          the [Arbitrary Message Bridge](https://docs.tokenbridge.net/amb-bridge/about-amb-bridge) to transfer relevant tokens to the main Ethereum chain,
          react.js for the user interface and no servers!

            I worked in a team of talented peoples that built a <mark>decentralized</mark> application for document tokenization; 
            we also developed an extension for a DeFi token to bridge it with Aave.

            I also sketched some ideas about the use of blockchain and cryptography to disintermediate authority in a concrete scenarios.

            I was in the ICO dev team.
            Later I co-designed the <mark>Ethereum</mark> smart-contracts of the TokenRaise platform which offers easy to use interfaces to create 
            your own token and launch any Blockchain crowdsale.

            I worked in teams responsible of evolving a proprietary <mark>telephone</mark> switch (c++) in a soft real time context. 
            Relevant projects: VOIP implementation and quality/cost-based call routing; an interactive voice responder (IVR) in python with Asterisk as phone server.

            The team pioneered the <mark>devops</mark> paradigm being responsible of the software development, hardware maintenance, 
            networking configuration and service operation.
